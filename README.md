# Kraken Master

Trading interface for effective trading of ethereum's ERC-20 tokens on exchange kraken.com.

Planned features:
* Basic GUI
 * Market depth & spread charts
 * Trading interface
 * Arbitrage charts
 * Price prediction
* Price alarms
* Alarms for high volume transactions to/from exchange
* Token tracking

The purpose of the project is to pass my OOP class :) and to improve my user-experience with trading on Kraken exchange, especially during high volume traffic.
